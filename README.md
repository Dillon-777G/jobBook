**Purpose**:

We have decided to create a Job Search web application similar to linked in. Our goal is to
create a functional prototype that allows users to create a profile, search for jobs, and interact
with employers.

**Project Members**:

Dillon Gaughan

Ravi Dhondkar

Alexander Lazarov

Malav Padhya

**Conflict Resolution**:

We can resolve conflicts internally by discussing them as a group as needed in our chat or during the meeting. If need be we can contact the professor for guidance.

**Communication Mechanism**:

We have chosen discord as our communication mechanism as it meets all of our needs. We will have one official meeting a week and stay in consistent.

**Decision Made**:

IDE- VScode, Intellij as a backup.

Dependency Management- Maven, Gradle as an alternative; We already understand maven.

Code- We are going to use lombok for reducing boiler plate code. We will also be using Junit for unit testing.

Configuration Management- XML.
