## **Purpose**:

We have decided to create a Job Search web application similar to linked in. Our goal is to
create a functional prototype that allows users to create a profile, search for jobs, and interact
with employers.

## **Conflict Resolution**:

We can resolve conflicts internally by discussing them as a group as needed in our chat or during the meeting. If need be we can contact the professor for guidance.

## **Communication Mechanism**:

We have chosen discord as our communication mechanism as it meets all of our needs. We will have one official meeting a week and stay in consistent.

## **Decision Made**:

| Category              | Choice       | Alternative  |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **IDE**               | VSCode       | IntelliJ     |
| **Dependency Management** | Maven    | Gradle       |
| **Code**              | Lombok for reducing boilerplate code; JUnit for unit testing |
| **Configuration Management** | XML |
